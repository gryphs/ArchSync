# ArchSync

### Feature
 - Move your structure easily between server and server & client
 - Easy to use, only two command needed
 - WorldEdit support
 
### Requirements
 - WorldEdit or FAWE installed
 
### How does it work?

ArchSync must have a file transfer server in order to work. The default is to use my own public server located in Los Angeles. (I would be delighted if you decided to donate for the project!)

To deploy your own one, please:

 1. Download this .php file and deploy it to your own server: [https://gist.github.com/gryphs/c698559de35c40f87c5d3553f07e3f07](https://gist.github.com/gryphs/c698559de35c40f87c5d3553f07e3f07)
 2. Change the plugin's config.yml and enter your own server's URL
 3. In the web client, click "Setting" and enter your own server's URL

Sometimes it's not very stable. That's why I recommend that you deploy your own transfer server by just a .php file.
